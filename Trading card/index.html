            The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey found in
            North America. A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a
            species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla),
            which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic.

          The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on
          fish, which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its
          talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the
          largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13
          ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in
          weight. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.
          Bald eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older
          meaning of the word, "white headed". The adult is mainly brown with a
          white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females
          are about 25 percent larger than males. The yellow beak is large and
          hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.
